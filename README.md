# Zé Delivery Frontend Challenge :beers:

## ℹ️ What's this challenge?
Its simple. The user needs to type an address inside a field and be redirected to a products list page. So your job as a front-end engineer will be to create 2 simple screens consuming and sending data to our API.

You can check out a flux sample at: https://www.ze.delivery/ (our production env)

We're using GraphQL (give a look to https://www.graphql.com/guides/)
